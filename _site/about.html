<p>EpiComp is the 6mm sci-fi miniature painting competition started in 2003 on the <a href="https://www.tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/" target="_blank">TacComm forums</a>. Basically, it's an excuse to show off what you've spent all year painting in the world of Epic models. Painters compete across a handful of categories in the hopes of claiming the glory of being the crowd favorite. Entry is free and explained on the <a href="{{ '/rules.html' | relative_url }}">Rules page</a>, so get painting and check back here towards the end of the year for plenty of Epic goodness.</p>
