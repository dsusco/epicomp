<p>The rules for participating in EpiComp are below, if you have questions please post them in the current year's rule thread on the <a href="https://www.tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/viewforum.php?f=19" target="_blank">TacComm EpiComp board</a>.</p>

<h2>Entering</h2>

<p>You do not have to be a member of the TacComm boards to enter (you do to vote, however). To enter, just e-mail <a href="mailto:epicompetitions(at)gmail(dot)com">epicompetitions(at)gmail(dot)com</a> with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your TacComm username, if you have one, or your name</li>
  <li>a image of your entry in <kbd>.jpg</kbd> format</li>
  <li>the title of your entry</li>
</ul>

<p>Entries should be models that you've completed during the past year and not previously entered in an EpiComp competition. Entries already posted on TacComms or elsewhere on the internet can be entered. You can enter each category as many times as you like, but a model may only appear once in any given category (e.g. your Spehss Mahreen stand may only appear once in Best Single Model, but may also appear in Best Formation). Composites are allowed but keep the image effects to a minimum (we're voting on your painting). Finally, <b>it really helps out</b> if you can name your file like this: <kbd>Your Entry's Title - Your Username/First Name.jpg</kbd> (e.g. <q>Best Entry Ever - Dave.jpg)</q>.</p>

<h2>Categories</h2>

<p>For the purposes of these categories, Epic models include models from any 6mm sci-fi manufacturer, a 6mm sci-fi conversion or a 6mm sci-fi 3D printed model.</p>

Each category with more than 10 entries will be broken down into heats and the winners of each heat will go onto the final for a second round of voting.</p>
